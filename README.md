# Download YouTube Videos through Google Colab

A small piece of code to download YouTube Subtitles using youtube-dl

Using this notebook you can utilise Googleâ€™s Virtual Python Environment Google Colab. Literally open up Google Colab in your Google Drive and insert this code in a new cell and add your video URLs.

Or you can make a copy of my Google Colab file directly [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JrsmYXmVpr4Ruazgk1xjUgWbvz06pi2C?usp=sharing).

If you are familiar with Python code or writing in Command Line, then visit https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/ for full instructions of how it all works.
